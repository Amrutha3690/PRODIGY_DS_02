# Train Passenger Data Analysis:
# Data Cleaning and Identifying Patterns and Trends:
## Step 1: Data Reading
Using the pandas module, I read the sample dataset which contains the train passenger report. This dataset includes various attributes such as Age, Sex, Fare, etc.
## Step 2: Data Cleaning
To ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis, I handled null values using several pandas functions.
### Line Chart Creation:
I used matplotlib to create a line chart showing the relationship between Age and Fare values. 
### Bar Chart Creation:
I created a bar chart to analyze the relationship between Sex and Fare.Patterns and Trends Identified:
- Age Group Spending: Passengers aged 35 to 45 spend significantly more on train fares.
- Gender Spending: Males travel more frequently and spend more than females.
